					<p>While global leaders express growing concern and criticism over the intensifying human rights crackdown in Azerbaijan, which has reached an unprecedented low with 331 political prisoners, Lionel Messi—a global football star and UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador—has chosen to pay tribute to Heydar Aliyev on the anniversary of his death, the former President of Azerbaijan and father of the incumbent leader, Ilham Aliyev. He also visited Heydar Aliyev Center and met with its Director, Assistant to the President of Azerbaijan, Anar Alakbarov. By doing so, Messi has contributed to the reinforcement of the Aliyev family’s cult of personality in Azerbaijan.</p>

					<p>Azerbaijan is a strange country. Here, a child is a source of security, an heir, a being who will carry you on their shoulders tomorrow. The approach of ‘a son carries you to the grave on his shoulders,’ ‘a daughter cries more’ is a mental value that has come down through the centuries. A child must stand in the shadow of those who brought them into this world throughout their entire life. If they want to live their own life, they are ungrateful, someone who has trampled on family values. Yet they had no role, no order in coming into this world…</p>

					<p>**Baku, Azerbaijan** – In a move that has drawn sharp criticism from international human rights and media organizations, an Azerbaijani court on June 20 handed down severe prison sentences to journalists from “Abzas Media” and Radio Azadliq’s Farid Mehralizade. The verdicts, which the journalists vehemently deny, are widely seen as politically motivated reprisals for their investigations into high-level corruption.</p>

					<p>Nurlan Libre, arrested in the &#92;“Meydan TV case,&#92;” writes from pre-trial detention:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#92;“We must live this life a little courageously, a little dangerously, taking risks. Especially since we are condemned to lose this life (whether good or bad) in any case.&#92;” – Friedrich Nietzsche&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was accepted to college at 16. At that time, in 2013, civil society institutions in the country, inspired by the international protests known as the “Arab Spring,” held demonstrations with democratic demands. Unfortunately, due to my young age, I could only watch the protests from afar.</p>
