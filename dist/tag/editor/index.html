				<h2>IRFS disappointed about Lionel Messi legitimizing the oppressive regime of Aliyev’s family</h2>
				
					<p>While global leaders express growing concern and criticism over the intensifying human rights crackdown in Azerbaijan, which has reached an unprecedented low with 331 political prisoners, Lionel Messi—a global football star and UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador—has chosen to pay tribute to Heydar Aliyev on the anniversary of his death, the former President of Azerbaijan and father of the incumbent leader, Ilham Aliyev. He also visited Heydar Aliyev Center and met with its Director, Assistant to the President of Azerbaijan, Anar Alakbarov. By doing so, Messi has contributed to the reinforcement of the Aliyev family’s cult of personality in Azerbaijan.</p>

				<h2>My Spiritual Torture</h2>
				
					<p>Azerbaijan is a strange country. Here, a child is a source of security, an heir, a being who will carry you on their shoulders tomorrow. The approach of ‘a son carries you to the grave on his shoulders,’ ‘a daughter cries more’ is a mental value that has come down through the centuries. A child must stand in the shadow of those who brought them into this world throughout their entire life. If they want to live their own life, they are ungrateful, someone who has trampled on family values. Yet they had no role, no order in coming into this world…</p>

				<h2>Azerbaijan Delivers Harsh Sentences to “Abzas Media” Journalists and Farid Mehralizade Amidst International Outcry</h2>
