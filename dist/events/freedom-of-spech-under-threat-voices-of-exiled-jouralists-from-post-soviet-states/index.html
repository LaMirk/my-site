<p>Across post-Soviet states, independent journalism is increasingly under attack. As regimes crack down on dissent, journalists are being forced into exile, stripped of their livelihoods, and targeted by legal, digital, and physical repression.</p>
<p>This side event brings together exiled journalists, human rights defenders, and international experts to shed light on the multi-layered threats to media freedom and to explore how cross-border repression is used to silence independent reporting. Panelists will share lived experiences, assess the effectiveness of existing protection mechanisms, and identify urgent gaps that must be addressed.</p>
