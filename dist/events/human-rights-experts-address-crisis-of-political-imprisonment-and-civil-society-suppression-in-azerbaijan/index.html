<p>The panel, held at the Palais des Nations, brought together leading human rights advocates to examine the interconnected threats facing journalists, activists, and civil society organizations in Azerbaijan. The discussion explored both the immediate human cost of repressive policies and their broader implications for democratic institutions and international human rights.</p>
<p>Emin Huseynov, Director of the Institute for Human Rights, addressed the current Azerbaijani landscape of political imprisonment and systematic persecution of dissidents, exposing how governments deploy internet shutdowns and social media blocks against critics while conducting an ongoing crackdown against civil society organizations through bans on foreign funding, travel restrictions, and other extreme limitations of fundamental human rights.</p>
<p>Igor Tenyuta, Consultant at the Institute for Human Rights, provided expert analysis on the legal and institutional frameworks being weaponized in Azerbaijan to suppress civil society organizations, presenting the compelling case of imprisoned Talysh researcher Igbal Abilov, who was unjustly detained on high treason charges and faces up to 18 years of imprisonment. Tenyuta examined how authoritarian regimes exploit legal systems to legitimize persecution of academics and researchers.</p>
<p>Zahra Kalantary, Advocacy Officer at the Institute for Reporters’ Freedom and Safety (IRFS), focused on the persecution of female journalists and activists, revealing the alarming fact that 9 brave female journalists are currently imprisoned simply for doing their job. Kalantary examined the systematic targeting of independent media and analyzed the devastating impact of media bans on democratic discourse and public information access in Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>The session was moderated by Mehman Huseynov, Blogger and Journalist, who guided the discussion through the complex intersections of media freedom, civil society space, and democratic governance.</p>
