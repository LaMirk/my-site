        <p>While global leaders express growing concern and criticism over the intensifying human rights crackdown in Azerbaijan, which has reached an unprecedented low with 331 political prisoners, Lionel Messi—a global football star and UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador—has chosen to pay tribute to Heydar Aliyev on the anniversary of his death, the former President of Azerbaijan and father of the incumbent leader, Ilham Aliyev. He also visited Heydar Aliyev Center and met with its Director, Assistant to the President of Azerbaijan, Anar Alakbarov. By doing so, Messi has contributed to the reinforcement of the Aliyev family’s cult of personality in Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>This act of legitimization by a person with a great public clout, who is perceived as a role model for millions of young people across the globe, comes at a time when one of the most corrupted and repressive regimes of the President Ilham Aliyev is engaging in an all-out assault on civil society and media freedoms, particularly in the lead-up to and aftermath of COP29. The crackdown has recently reached unprecedented levels, as evidenced by the mass detention of up to 15 representatives of independent civil society organizations and media outlets within just 24 hours on December 6, 2024.</p>
<p>International figures and institutions have widely criticised Messi’s move. On December 10, 2024, at the U.S. Department of State Human Rights Defender Award Ceremony, Secretary Antony Blinken personally addressed the case of Azerbaijani human rights defender Rufat Safarov. Safarov, who was preparing to travel to the United States to receive this prestigious honor, was unjustly detained by the Azerbaijani government. Moreover, Azerbaijani journalist, Sevinj Vagifgizi was recognized as an Anti-Corruption Champion in absentia for her dedication to exposing high-level corruption in Azerbaijan by the Department of State on December 9, 2024.</p>
<p>Secretary Blinken strongly condemned these arrests and called for immediate release of Rufat Safarov and Sevinj Vagifgizi, as well as the release of all journalists, human rights defenders, political opponents, and others unjustly detained in Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>In this dire context, Messi`s decision to participate in an event glorifying the Aliyev regime not only whitewashes its egregious human rights abuses but above all, undermines the credibility of his role as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. Emin Huseynov, Co-Founder of the Climate Observers Partnership, remarked, “We find it particularly appalling to witness Messi, a Goodwill Ambassador, come to Azerbaijan and whitewash the image of the regime amidst intensifying crackdown on human rights. We call on the UNICEF to pay close attention to his act and re-evaluate his status.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, Messi’s actions require a public apology, in the first place, to the people of Azerbaijan. Solidarity with the oppressed must take precedence over superficial gestures that serve authoritarian interests.</p>
<p>“While the government of Azerbaijan resorted to international football stars to whitewash its corrupted and kleptocratic image, in Azerbaijan, football fans are often used by the regime to achieve its goals, and the football players themselves are behind the murders of journalists. In particular, football player of the Azerbaijani club Qabala FK, Cavid Huseynov, and his family members are connected with the murder of Rasim Aliyev in 2015, who was among the fellow employees of IRFS,” says Emin Huseynov.</p>
<p>We also call on Inter Miami to reflect on the decision of its players (Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez, Sergio Busquets, and Jordi Alba) to visit Azerbaijan on the payroll of a government-related businessman, former Executive of SOCAR Trading, Adnan Ahmadzada.</p>
<p>IRFS additionally calls on international major brands (namely, Adidas, Pepsi, MasterCard, Huawei, Lay`s, BitGet, Gatorade, Budweiser, Beats by Dre, etc.) that have endorsement contracts with Lionel Messi to carefully monitor and analyze the implications of his recent actions.</p>
<p>By associating with an oppressive regime, Messi has undermined the principles of human rights, democracy, good governance and transparency values that many of these brands publicly advocate.</p>
<p>We urge these companies to show their solidarity with the people of Azerbaijan and take a principled stance by reconsidering and revoking their contracts with Messi. Aligning with figures who legitimize authoritarian regimes risks tarnishing their reputation and contradicting their stated commitments to social responsibility.</p>
