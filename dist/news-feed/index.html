Especially since we are condemned to lose this life (whether good or bad) in any case.&#92;” – Friedrich Nietzsche&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was accepted to college at 16. At that time, in 2013, civil society institutions in the country, inspired by the international protests known as the “Arab Spring,” held demonstrations with democratic demands. Unfortunately, due to my young age, I could only watch the protests from afar.</p>
