        <p><strong>Aynur Elgunesh (Ganbarova)</strong>, the arrested editor-in-chief of Meydan TV, has been awarded a prestigious international prize by the <strong>International Women’s Media Foundation (IWMF)</strong>. The recognition comes as Azerbaijan faces increasing international scrutiny over its crackdown on independent media and civil society.</p>
<p>Elgunesh was declared the winner of the “2025 Wallis Annenberg Justice for Women Journalists Award,” an honor aimed at drawing global attention to women journalists unjustly imprisoned worldwide. According to the IWMF, “Sharing the stories of imprisoned women journalists is crucial for ensuring the safety of women journalists.” The award ceremony is scheduled to take place in New York City in November 2025. The IWMF previously recognized Azerbaijani journalist <strong>Khadija Ismayilova</strong> with the “Courage in Journalism Award” in 2012, highlighting a pattern of concerns regarding press freedom in the country.</p>
<p>The IWMF emphasized Elgunesh’s extensive investigative work, which covered critical topics such as human trafficking, the rights of internally displaced persons, and government corruption. Her dedication to media freedom earned her widespread recognition. The organization also raised concerns about her well-being, noting that Elgunesh, who has a disability, was reportedly mistreated during her arrest at home and that her life is in direct danger while she is held in Baku Pre-trial Detention Center.</p>
<p>Elgunesh’s arrest is part of a broader sweep targeting Meydan TV and other independent voices. On December 6, 2024, Elgunesh, along with six other Meydan TV journalists – <strong>Ramin Deko (Jabrayilzade)</strong>, <strong>Aysel Umudova</strong>, <strong>Aytaj Tapdiq (Ahmadova)</strong>, <strong>Khayala Agayeva</strong>, and <strong>Natig Javadli</strong> – were detained. They were charged under Article 206.3.2 of the Criminal Code, which pertains to smuggling committed by a group of persons in prior collusion, and were placed in four-month pre-trial detention. On the same day, civil society member <strong>Ulvi Tahirov</strong>, who is not affiliated with Meydan TV, was also detained under the same charge.</p>
<p>The crackdown continued into 2025. On February 5, <strong>Shamshad Agayev (Aga)</strong>, editor-in-chief of “Arqument.az” and a collaborator with Meydan TV, was detained. Subsequently, journalists <strong>Nurlan Libre (Gahramanli)</strong>, <strong>Fatima Movlamli</strong>, and <strong>Ulviyya Ali (Guliyeva)</strong> were also arrested in connection with the “Meydan TV case.” Searches were conducted at the homes of the detained journalists, and their personal belongings, including phones and computers, were confiscated.</p>
<p>All arrested journalists deny the charges against them, asserting that the smuggling accusations are fabricated and that they are being punished for their critical professional activities. This sentiment is echoed by international human rights organizations and Western officials, who have consistently called on the Azerbaijani government to release those unjustly detained.</p>
<p>The IWMF highlighted that threats, attacks, government pressure, unequal pay, and accusations of spreading fake news pose a severe threat to press freedom globally, with women journalists disproportionately affected. A UNESCO report cited by the IWMF revealed that 73% of women journalists surveyed reported experiencing online violence due to their work.</p>
<p>Local human rights organizations report a concerning trend, with over 30 journalists and public activists arrested on similar smuggling charges since November 2023. Many of these individuals have seen their charges aggravated. According to lists compiled by these organizations, there are now more than 350 political prisoners in Azerbaijani prisons. Conversely, Azerbaijani officials maintain that no one in the country is arrested due to their professional activities or political motives, asserting that individuals are held accountable solely for actions they have committed.</p>
<p>The award to Aynur Elgunesh underscores the ongoing challenges faced by independent journalists in Azerbaijan and serves as a powerful reminder of the international community’s commitment to supporting press freedom and recognizing the courage of those who uphold it despite significant personal risk.</p>
