        <p>Seven journalists from Azerbaijan’s independent Abzas Media outlet have been sentenced to lengthy prison terms ranging from 7.5 to 9 years, prompting fierce condemnation from Amnesty International, which described the case as a textbook example of how Azerbaijan’s judicial system has been weaponized to silence critical journalism.</p>
<p>The sentences, handed down on June 20 by the Baku Court of Grave Crimes, represent what human rights advocates say is the latest escalation in Azerbaijan’s systematic campaign to crush independent media and intimidate government critics.</p>
<h2>The Sentences and Charges</h2>
<p>The court sentenced Abzas Media director Ulvi Hasanli, editor-in-chief Sevinj Vaqifqizi, investigative journalist Hafiz Babali, and Radio Liberty journalist and economist Farid Mehralizada to 9 years in prison. Journalists Nargiz Absalamova and Elnara Qasimova received 8-year sentences, while coordinator and translator Mahammad Kekalov was sentenced to 7 years and 6 months.</p>
<p>The journalists face charges including currency smuggling, money laundering, tax evasion, and document forgery—allegations they have consistently rejected as fabricated. Throughout the proceedings, all seven maintained their innocence and argued they were being punished for their investigative work exposing high-level corruption.</p>
<h2>Investigative Work That Sparked Persecution</h2>
<p>Abzas Media had gained prominence for its hard-hitting investigations into corruption networks connected to President Ilham Aliyev’s family and inner circle. Their reporting exposed illegal financial schemes involving post-war reconstruction efforts in Karabagh and questionable dealings with state-affiliated companies.</p>
<p>These investigations into what Amnesty International called “high-level corruption facts” appear to have directly triggered the government’s legal action against the outlet, according to human rights observers.</p>
<h2>International Condemnation</h2>
<p>Mari Struthers, Amnesty International’s Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, issued a scathing statement condemning the sentences as part of Azerbaijan’s broader strategy to silence dissent.</p>
<p>“By bringing fabricated economic charges against journalists who expose high-level corruption facts, the Azerbaijani authorities intimidate everyone in the country who dares to challenge them,” Struthers said. “This is unacceptable and must receive a harsh and clear response from the international world.”</p>
<p>The human rights organization characterized the case as demonstrating “how Azerbaijan’s court system has been turned into a weapon to silence independent journalism” and called for a strong international reaction.</p>
<p>Struthers also criticized the international community’s tepid response to Azerbaijan’s mounting repression, noting that “major players like the European Union continue active cooperation with President Ilham Aliyev in order to obtain more profitable gas deals” despite the deteriorating human rights situation.</p>
<h2>Flawed Legal Proceedings</h2>
<p>The court proceedings themselves were marked by significant irregularities, according to defense lawyers. Multiple witnesses retracted their previous statements during the trial or declared them untrue, while defendants reported poor treatment in detention. The defense team highlighted procedural violations, pressure on defendants and witnesses, and the absence of reliable evidence supporting the charges.</p>
<p>Despite these procedural concerns, the court proceeded with the convictions, underscoring what critics say is the predetermined nature of politically motivated prosecutions in Azerbaijan.</p>
<h2>Wider Crackdown on Media Freedom</h2>
<p>The Abzas Media case represents just one facet of Azerbaijan’s broader assault on press freedom. At least 25 journalists are currently imprisoned in the country, making Azerbaijan one of the world’s worst jailers of media professionals relative to its size.</p>
<p>Since joining the Council of Europe in 2001, Azerbaijan has become notorious as one of the member states with the highest number of journalists imprisoned on politically motivated charges. The crackdown extends beyond Abzas Media to other independent outlets including Toplum TV, Meydan TV, and Kanal 13, all of which have staff members behind bars.</p>
<p>Amnesty International is demanding immediate action from the international community, calling for real pressure on Azerbaijani authorities to secure the release of all imprisoned journalists and government critics detained for exercising their right to freedom of expression.</p>
<p>“The government’s systematic campaign aimed at suppressing opposition voices must be stopped,” Struthers emphasized, urging world leaders to move beyond diplomatic niceties and take concrete steps to address what she described as Azerbaijan’s “astonishingly serious” political repressions.</p>
<p>The Azerbaijani government has consistently denied that it arrests journalists for their professional activities, maintaining that all prosecutions are based on legitimate criminal charges rather than media work. However, the pattern of targeting investigative journalists who report on sensitive political and economic topics suggests otherwise to international observers.</p>
<p>With the sentences now finalized, the focus shifts to whether international pressure can force Azerbaijan to reverse course on its media crackdown. The case serves as a test of whether the global community will prioritize human rights concerns over economic interests in its dealings with the Aliyev government.</p>
<p>The fate of the Abzas Media journalists—and the dozens of other imprisoned media workers in Azerbaijan—may well depend on whether democratic nations are willing to back their expressions of concern with meaningful consequences for a regime that has shown little regard for press freedom or judicial independence.</p>
