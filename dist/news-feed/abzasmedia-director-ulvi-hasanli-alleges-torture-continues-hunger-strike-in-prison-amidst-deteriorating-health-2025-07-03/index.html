      <div class="[ page-content ] [ flow wrapper ] [ flow-space-700 gap-top-700 ]">
        <p>Ulvi Hasanli, the imprisoned director of Azerbaijan’s independent news outlet “AbzasMedia,” is reportedly enduring torture and inhumane treatment in Umbakı prison, where he has been on a hunger strike since June 26. His health has significantly deteriorated, with his weight dropping from 77 kg to 71 kg. Hasanli’s actions are a protest against his allegedly illegal transfer to Umbakı prison before his sentence legally came into force, as well as the denial of family visits.</p>
<h3>Latest Developments and Allegations of Mistreatment</h3>
<p>On July 1, Hasanli’s lawyer, <strong>Zibeyda Sadigova</strong>, was finally able to meet with him at Umbakı prison. During their meeting, Hasanli confirmed he has been held in solitary confinement (known as “karser”) since June 26, the day he began his hunger strike.</p>
<p>His wife, <strong>Rubaba Guliyeva</strong>, shared alarming details with “Abzas Media” following a phone conversation with him on June 30—the first contact after five days of silence. She reported that Ulvi’s voice sounded “very bad” and that he stated he had been subjected to “pressure, threats, and torture” for initiating the hunger strike.</p>
<p>Further allegations of mistreatment include:</p>
<p><strong>Physical Violence:</strong> Hasanli’s family claims that two detention center employees, <strong>Ramin Akbarov</strong> and a person named <strong>Pərviz</strong>, used violence against him, pushing him and tearing his clothes. During this incident, Ulvi reportedly hit a bed and injured his leg, with traces of injuries still visible on his body.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of Basic Necessities:</strong> Hasanli has not been given any personal belongings, including clean clothes, since his transfer. He has been wearing the same clothes for days. He also reported being given an old, broken bed without bedding, which has caused him to develop back pain and other health problems. Despite his worsening condition, he has not been medically examined.</p>
<p><strong>Denial of Family Visits:</strong> Hasanli was informed he would not be allowed to meet with his wife and their two-year-old daughter due to the absence of an “official marriage certificate.” This denial of visitation rights is a key reason for his continued hunger strike.</p>
<p><strong>Illegal Decisions:</strong> Hasanli explicitly stated that <strong>Fikrat Gafarov</strong>, the head of Operational-Regime Affairs of the Penitentiary Service, was responsible for signing the “illegal decisions” concerning him.</p>
<p>Hasanli has declared he will not cease his hunger strike until he is permitted to see his family and is returned to the Baku Investigation Detention Center, as stipulated by his court decision until his verdict legally comes into effect. In a show of solidarity, female journalists from “Abzas Media” currently held at the Baku Investigation Detention Center have announced they will join Hasanli’s hunger strike if his demands are not met.</p>
<p>The defense team, including lawyer Zibeyda Sadigova, has appealed to both the Penitentiary Service and the Ombudsman’s Office regarding these serious concerns. Calls to the Ombudsman’s Office have reportedly gone unanswered, while the Penitentiary Service generally maintains that it treats convicts within legal frameworks.</p>
<h3>The Broader “AbzasMedia Case”</h3>
<p>Ulvi Hasanli’s current plight is part of a wider crackdown on independent media in Azerbaijan. The “AbzasMedia case” saw seven journalists receive harsh sentences on June 20, 2025, at the Baku Court for Serious Crimes, presided over by Judge <strong>Rasim Sadikhov</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Ulvi Hasanli</strong>, <strong>Sevinj Vagifgizi (Abbasova)</strong>, <strong>Hafiz Babali</strong>, and <strong>Farid Mehralizada</strong> were each sentenced to 9 years of imprisonment.</p>
<p><strong>Nargiz Absalamova</strong> and <strong>Elnara Gasimova</strong> received 8 years.</p>
<p><strong>Mahammad Kekalov</strong> was sentenced to 7 years and 6 months of imprisonment.</p>
<p>These journalists were accused of various offenses, including currency smuggling, illegal entrepreneurship, money laundering, and tax evasion. However, they vehemently deny these charges, asserting that their arrests and convictions are politically motivated reprisals for their professional journalistic activities, particularly their investigations exposing corruption involving high-ranking officials, including Azerbaijani President <strong>Ilham Aliyev</strong> and his close circle.</p>
<p>The arrests in the “AbzasMedia” case began on November 20, 2023, with Farid Mehralizada, a journalist and economist for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, also detained in May 2024 as part of the same case, though “Abzas Media” stated they did not cooperate with him. The preliminary and judicial investigations lasted nearly two years.</p>
<h3>International Concern and Official Stance</h3>
<p>The <strong>Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ)</strong> has issued a strong statement expressing serious concern over the reports of human rights violations and alleged torture against Ulvi Hasanli. The CPJ has unequivocally called for the immediate release of Ulvi Hasanli and his colleagues.</p>
<p>This situation is reflective of a broader trend in Azerbaijan. Since November 2023, more than 30 journalists and public activists have been arrested, primarily on smuggling charges. Local human rights organizations estimate there are currently over 370 political prisoners in Azerbaijani prisons. Conversely, Azerbaijani officials consistently deny that anyone is arrested for their professional activities or on political grounds, claiming that those listed are prosecuted for criminal acts. International human rights organizations, however, continue to urge the government to release those unjustly detained.</p>
<p>Ulvi Hasanli’s unwavering commitment to his hunger strike underscores the severe conditions and alleged injustices faced by independent journalists in Azerbaijan. As his health deteriorates and allegations of torture persist, the international community’s calls for his and his colleagues’ immediate release are growing louder, highlighting the critical state of media freedom and human rights in the country.</p>
