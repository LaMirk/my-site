        <p>The ongoing legal proceedings against independent Azerbaijani media outlet “Toplum TV” continued on June 30, 2025, at the Baku Court of Grave Crimes, where the Tax Ministry formally demanded 79,000 manats from the defendants. The hearing, primarily chaired by Judge Azer Taghiyev, saw the accused reiterate their claims of political motivation behind their arrests and the charges leveled against them.</p>
<p>The “Toplum TV case” is part of a broader crackdown on independent media and civil society in Azerbaijan. On March 6, 2024, police raided and sealed the office of “Toplum TV” in Baku. The media outlet subsequently announced its decision to continue operations through journalists abroad starting from February 2024, citing the impossibility of functioning within the country.</p>
<p>Initially, the 10 individuals arrested in connection with the case were charged with smuggling under Article 206.3.2 of the Criminal Code. However, on January 17, 2025, these charges were escalated to more severe offenses. The defendants consistently reject all accusations, asserting that their arrests are politically ordered and directly linked to their professional and civic activities. This case aligns with a concerning trend since November 2023, during which approximately 30 journalists and public activists in Azerbaijan have been arrested, predominantly on smuggling charges. Azerbaijani authorities, however, maintain that no one is persecuted for their professional or political activities, and that all rights and freedoms are ensured in the country.</p>
<p><strong>Key Developments from the Latest Hearing</strong></p>
<p>During the June 30 hearing, several defendants presented motions and statements challenging the proceedings and the charges:</p>
<p><strong>Judicial Recusal Attempt:</strong> Farid Ismayilov, a journalist with “Toplum TV,” filed a motion requesting the recusal of Judge Elnur Nuriyev (who was part of the judicial panel, though Judge Azer Taghiyev chaired the overall proceedings). Ismayilov argued that Nuriyev had issued “ordered decisions” in other politically motivated cases, making his impartiality questionable. The motion was denied.</p>
<p><strong>Alasgar Mammadli’s Grievances:</strong> Alasgar Mammadli, co-founder of “Toplum TV” and a prominent media expert, detailed his post-arrest ordeal. He stated that since his detention in March 2024, the Tax Ministry demanded he declare his income and subsequently fined him. Mammadli also revealed that his attempts to obtain a document for notarial transactions from the investigation were denied. He requested the court to bring this issue to the attention of the Tax Ministry, a motion that was granted.</p>
<p><strong>Defendants’ Rebuttals and Statements</strong></p>
<p>The core of the defense’s arguments revolved around the perceived absurdity and political nature of the charges:</p>
<p><strong>“Crime for Selfish Purposes” Allegation:</strong> Alasgar Mammadli vehemently rejected the accusation that he committed a crime for “selfish purposes.” He stated, “I taught for free at the Law Faculty of Baku State University, and I donated my salary to the faculty. Now they tell me that I committed a crime for selfish purposes.”</p>
<p><strong>“Organized Group” Claim Debunked:</strong> Mammadli also challenged the claim that the defendants constituted an “organized group” operating since 2014. He highlighted the age of co-defendant Ilkin Amrahov at that time: “Ilkin Amrahov, who was arrested with us, was 12 years old at that time. How could he have been a member of an organized group at 12?” He further added that despite charges of “illegal employment,” none of the 9 defendants or 49 witnesses testified that he had invited anyone to work.</p>
<p><strong>“Only Guilt is Protest”:</strong> Ruslan Izzatli, a founding member of the III Republic Platform, articulated the defendants’ stance on their alleged “guilt.” He stated, “Our only guilt is that for over 30 years we have protested against the establishment of an authoritarian system, demanded the rule of law, wanted a parliamentary government, a transparent and accountable state, prioritized human dignity above all, and desired a society that governs, not one that is governed.”</p>
<p><strong>Broader Media Crackdown:</strong> Ali Zeynal, an employee of the Institute of Democratic Initiatives (IDI), rejected the charges not only in the “Toplum TV case” but also in the “AbzasMedia” and “Meydan TV” cases, indicating a pattern of pressure on independent media. He also noted the irony of the situation, recalling that Alasgar Mammadli himself advocated for ethical conduct in media, stating, “When bloggers abroad began publishing materials targeting the Azerbaijani government and earned the name ‘insulting opposition,’ Alasgar Mammadli himself opposed it and said that our path should be the opposite; we should do everything within ethical norms. But the government shows that it deserves what those bloggers abroad are doing.”</p>
<p><strong>Lack of Evidence:</strong> Mushfiq Jabbar, video editor for “Toplum TV,” emphasized the prosecution’s failure to present evidence. “First, they said an investigation was underway; now the investigation is complete, but there is still nothing,” he stated, adding that extensions to the investigation period were never justified.</p>
<p><strong>Unclear Indictment:</strong> Ramil Babayev, an IDI employee, asserted the legality of his work at the organization and rejected the charges, promising to reveal “who the real culprits are in his final statement.” Ilkin Amrahov, another IDI employee, stated that the claims in the indictment were entirely unclear to him. Farid Ismayilov also rejected the charges, noting his “only guilt” was being unable to complete reports he started while under police supervision.</p>
<p><strong>The Tax Ministry’s Demand and Defense Objections</strong></p>
<p>A significant development in the hearing was the Tax Ministry’s demand for 79,000 manats to be paid to the state budget by the defendants, acting as a victim in the proceedings. Defense lawyers Rasul Jafarov and Fakhraddin Mehdiyev, along with defendant Ramil Babayev, strongly objected to this demand. Babayev argued that demanding the same amount from all defendants, despite their varying periods of employment at “Toplum TV” or IDI, further indicates the politically motivated nature of the case.</p>
<p>Currently, Alasgar Mammadli, Mushfiq Jabbar, Farid Ismayilov, Akif Gurbanov, Ruslan Izzatli, Ali Zeynal, Ramil Babayev, and Ilkin Amrahov remain in custody. Journalist Elmir Abbasov has been placed under police supervision, while “Toplum TV” editor Shahnaz Beylarqizi was initially under house arrest and later also placed under police supervision.</p>
<p>The next court hearing in the “Toplum TV case” is scheduled for July 7 at 10:00 AM. The case continues to draw attention as a critical indicator of the state of independent media and freedom of expression in Azerbaijan.</p>
