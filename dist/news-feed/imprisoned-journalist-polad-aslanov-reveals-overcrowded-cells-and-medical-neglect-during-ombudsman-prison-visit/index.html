      <p>Imprisoned journalist Polad Aslanov has exposed shocking conditions at Azerbaijan’s Penitentiary Institution No. 15 during a recent visit by representatives from the Ombudsman’s Office, revealing overcrowded cells where prisoners sleep on floors and systematic denial of medical care.</p>
<p>The meetings, which took place on June 14-15, only occurred after Aslanov’s wife publicly shamed officials on social media when they initially refused to meet with the detained journalist despite spending three hours at the facility.</p>
<h2>A Case of Alleged Political Persecution</h2>
<p>Polad Aslanov, head of the “xeberman.com” website, was arrested on June 12, 2019, on espionage charges under Article 274 of Azerbaijan’s Criminal Code for alleged treason against the state. Originally sentenced to 16 years in prison, his term was later reduced to 13 years by the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Aslanov firmly rejects all charges, maintaining that he was persecuted for his critical journalistic activities exposing government corruption. Human rights organizations have recognized him as a political prisoner, and significantly, the European Court of Human Rights confirmed that his arrest was unlawful and awarded compensation, which the Azerbaijani government has paid.</p>
<h2>The Ombudsman Visit: Initial Refusal and Social Media Intervention</h2>
<p>The June 14 meeting nearly didn’t happen at all. According to Aslanov’s wife, Gülmirə Aslanova, the Ombudsman representatives spent three hours at the penitentiary but initially refused to meet with her husband.</p>
<p>“June 14 was Polad’s calling day. He called me and said that representatives of the Ombudsman’s Office had been at the penitentiary for three hours but had not received him. After I made this public on social media, the representatives of the Ombudsman’s Office returned and received Polad,” Gülmirə Aslanova told Meydan TV.</p>
<h2>Shocking Prison Conditions Revealed</h2>
<p>During his meetings with Ombudsman representatives, Aslanov provided what his wife described as “visual” evidence of the deplorable conditions. The revelations paint a disturbing picture of systematic human rights violations:</p>
<h3>Severe Overcrowding</h3>
<p>“In the cell where he is held, three to five prisoners sleep on the floor, under the feet of other prisoners,” Aslanova reported, describing conditions that violate basic human dignity standards.</p>
<h3>Medical Neglect and Exploitation</h3>
<p>Aslanov detailed systematic medical neglect spanning years. “This year he was held in the medical unit for more than a month, but they did not examine him, only provided nutritional support and ‘B’ group vitamin preparations for temporary calming of his nerves,” his wife explained.</p>
<p>Even more concerning, Aslanov reported that medicines are being sold to prisoners for money rather than provided as a basic right, representing a form of exploitation of vulnerable detainees.</p>
<h3>Financial Extortion</h3>
<p>In a particularly shocking revelation, Aslanov told Ombudsman representatives that “100 manats are collected from each prisoner for the bathhouse being built in the penitentiary,” suggesting systematic financial extortion within the facility.</p>
<h2>Systemic Denial of Legal Rights</h2>
<p>Beyond the physical conditions, Aslanov’s case reveals broader systematic violations of prisoners’ legal rights. Despite repeated appeals since 2019 for medical examination and treatment, his requests have gone unanswered.</p>
<p>“He had repeatedly appealed to prison director Rəşad Əhədov and the Ministry of Justice regarding detention conditions, but received no response,” his wife stated.</p>
<p>Perhaps most troubling from a legal standpoint, Aslanov complained that decisions regarding criminal cases opened against him and later terminated are not being provided to him or his lawyer. This includes a case concerning his alleged torture while held at Baku Investigation Detention Center.</p>
<p>“They do not give him the termination decisions for all cases so that Polad cannot appeal from the decision to local and European courts. Polad is deprived of his right to self-defense,” Gülmirə Aslanova explained.</p>
<h2>Conflict of Interest in Prisoner Placement</h2>
<p>Aslanov also raised concerns about being housed with prisoners who allegedly participated in slandering him, noting that “by law, two prisoners who have conflicts or disputes between them are prohibited from being held in the same penitentiary institution.”</p>
<h2>Official Silence and Standard Denials</h2>
<p>As of publication, neither the Ombudsman’s Office nor the Penitentiary Service have responded to these specific allegations. However, the Penitentiary Service has previously stated in response to similar complaints that prisoners are held “in accordance with the requirements of legislation and international norms.”</p>
<p>Aslanov submitted a written petition addressed to Ombudsman Səbinə Əliyeva documenting his complaints, and was reportedly promised that these appeals would be reviewed.</p>
<h2>Azerbaijan’s Political Prisoner Crisis</h2>
<p>Aslanov’s case reflects broader concerns about Azerbaijan’s treatment of journalists and political prisoners. According to lists prepared by local human rights organizations, approximately 370 political prisoners are currently held in Azerbaijan’s prisons.</p>
<p>Government officials consistently deny that anyone is arrested for professional activities or political reasons, claiming those on such lists “have been held accountable solely for the acts they committed.”</p>
<p>However, international recognition of cases like Aslanov’s – including the European Court’s ruling on the unlawfulness of his detention – suggests a different reality for independent journalists and government critics in Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>Aslanov continues to serve his 13-year sentence while maintaining his innocence. His wife’s decision to make the Ombudsman visit public on social media proved effective in forcing the meeting, highlighting both the power of public pressure and the apparent reluctance of officials to engage with high-profile political prisoners.</p>
<p>The case raises fundamental questions about Azerbaijan’s compliance with international human rights standards and its treatment of independent media, particularly as Aslanov’s detention continues despite the European Court’s finding that his arrest was unlawful.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman’s Office’s response to Aslanov’s documented complaints will serve as an important test of Azerbaijan’s commitment to addressing systematic human rights violations in its prison system.</p>
