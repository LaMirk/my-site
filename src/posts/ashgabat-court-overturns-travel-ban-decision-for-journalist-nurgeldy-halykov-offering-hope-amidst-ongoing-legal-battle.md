**Ashgabat, Turkmenistan** – In a significant development for press freedom and human rights in Turkmenistan, the Ashgabat City Court on July 3 overturned a lower court’s decision that had upheld a travel ban against independent journalist Nurgeldy Halykov. The case has been sent back to the Kopetdag District Court for reconsideration, this time before a different judge.

Halykov, a 30-year-old correspondent for the independent news outlet turkmen.news, has been embroiled in a protracted legal struggle since his release from prison last year. His initial arrest in September 2020 and subsequent four-year sentence for fraud were widely condemned by human rights defenders, who assert that the charges were fabricated. They believe the true reason for his detention was his reporting, specifically for sharing photographs of World Health Organization (WHO) representatives during their visit to Turkmenistan amid the coronavirus pandemic.

After serving his full term, Halykov was released in June 2024. Eager to resume his professional life, he secured a job with a hospitality company in the UAE and attempted to depart Turkmenistan in January 2025. However, at Ashgabat airport, special service representatives prevented him from boarding his flight to Dubai, informing him he was on a “no-fly list.”

In his efforts to challenge this unlawful restriction, Halykov appealed to the Kopetdag District Court. On May 14, Judge Jennet Almazova initially denied his complaint, citing point 5, part 1, article 30 of Turkmenistan’s Law on Migration. This article permits travel bans for individuals under administrative supervision or with an unexpunged criminal record. However, the full text of the provision specifies that it applies only to convictions for “particularly serious crimes” or “particularly dangerous recidivism.” Halykov’s fraud conviction, classified as a moderately severe crime, does not fall under these stricter criteria.

During the initial court hearing, a representative from the migration service stated that their agency had no personal objections to Halykov’s travel but was merely executing a directive from an unnamed “competent authority.” This vague attribution has fueled suspicions that the ban is politically motivated rather than legally justified.

The Ashgabat City Court’s decision to overturn the first instance ruling offers a glimmer of hope for Halykov and his supporters. Many view it as a potential step towards justice prevailing, allowing the young journalist to finally leave the country for work. Public reactions, as seen in online commentary, are mixed – while some express cautious optimism, others remain skeptical, highlighting the perceived lack of an independent judiciary in Turkmenistan and warning of potential further provocations from state security agencies. Conversely, some commenters attribute the positive turn to the wisdom and fairness of President Serdar Berdimukhamedov.

Regardless of the underlying motivations, the case remains a critical test of legal transparency and human rights in Turkmenistan. The upcoming reconsideration by a new judge in the Kopetdag District Court will be closely watched as Halykov continues his fight for the right to travel freely.
