GENEVA, Switzerland– June 20, 2025 – The Institute for Human Rights (IHR) and The Institute for Reporters’ Freedom and Safety (IRFS) hosted a critical dialogue on the escalating global crisis of political imprisonment and systematic suppression of civil society organizations during the 59th session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.

The panel, held at the Palais des Nations, brought together leading human rights advocates to examine the interconnected threats facing journalists, activists, and civil society organizations in Azerbaijan. The discussion explored both the immediate human cost of repressive policies and their broader implications for democratic institutions and international human rights.

Emin Huseynov, Director of the Institute for Human Rights, addressed the current Azerbaijani landscape of political imprisonment and systematic persecution of dissidents, exposing how governments deploy internet shutdowns and social media blocks against critics while conducting an ongoing crackdown against civil society organizations through bans on foreign funding, travel restrictions, and other extreme limitations of fundamental human rights.

Igor Tenyuta, Consultant at the Institute for Human Rights, provided expert analysis on the legal and institutional frameworks being weaponized in Azerbaijan to suppress civil society organizations, presenting the compelling case of imprisoned Talysh researcher Igbal Abilov, who was unjustly detained on high treason charges and faces up to 18 years of imprisonment. Tenyuta examined how authoritarian regimes exploit legal systems to legitimize persecution of academics and researchers.

Zahra Kalantary, Advocacy Officer at the Institute for Reporters’ Freedom and Safety (IRFS), focused on the persecution of female journalists and activists, revealing the alarming fact that 9 brave female journalists are currently imprisoned simply for doing their job. Kalantary examined the systematic targeting of independent media and analyzed the devastating impact of media bans on democratic discourse and public information access in Azerbaijan.

The session was moderated by Mehman Huseynov, Blogger and Journalist, who guided the discussion through the complex intersections of media freedom, civil society space, and democratic governance.

Key Issues Addressed

The panel highlighted several critical areas of concern:

* Digital Repression: Documentation of systematic internet shutdowns and social media blocking targeting critics and opposition voices, undermining digital rights and access to information
* Civil Society Crackdown: Analysis of coordinated attacks on CSOs through foreign funding bans, travel restrictions, and administrative harassment designed to cripple independent organizations
* Escalating Political Imprisonment: Documentation of increasing numbers of political prisoners worldwide, including the case of Talysh researcher Igbal Abilov facing up to 18 years imprisonment on fabricated high treason charges, highlighting the targeting of academics and researchers
* Gender-Based Persecution: Urgent attention to the imprisonment of 9 female journalists who are detained solely for their professional work, demonstrating the particular vulnerability of women in media
* Legal Weaponization: Analysis of how authoritarian regimes manipulate legal frameworks to criminalize legitimate civil society activities, academic research, and peaceful dissent
* Media Suppression: Examination of systematic efforts to silence independent journalism through licensing restrictions, criminal prosecutions, and outright bans
* Democratic Erosion: Discussion of how these repressive tactics undermine democratic institutions and international human rights commitments
