**A sudden and severe deterioration of relations between Russia and Azerbaijan has erupted following a series of reciprocal, violent law enforcement operations. What began with a Russian anti-crime raid in Yekaterinburg, leading to deaths and detentions, quickly escalated into a full-blown diplomatic crisis with significant human and economic implications.**

The past week has seen a rapid escalation of tensions between Baku and Moscow, marked by tit-for-tat actions that have left two Azerbaijanis dead in Russia, several dozen individuals detained in both countries, and mutual accusations of unfriendly conduct. This crisis, rooted in deeper geopolitical currents, now threatens to undermine strategic alliances and economic ties.

### The Spark: Yekaterinburg Operation Ignites Crisis

The immediate trigger for the current diplomatic storm was a Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) operation conducted on June 27 in Yekaterinburg. Russian law enforcement raided homes inhabited by Azerbaijanis, stating their primary objective was to investigate a murder committed in 2001 that had remained unsolved for years.

However, the operation quickly turned tragic. Brothers **Ziyaddin and Huseyn Safarov**, originally from Azerbaijan’s Aghdam region, lost their lives. Russian police initially claimed the deaths were due to heart attacks. In stark contrast, the Azerbaijani side, following an expert examination, asserted that the brothers were “murdered with particular cruelty” and died from “torture and numerous injuries sustained in detention.”

More than 50 Azerbaijanis were reportedly detained during the Yekaterinburg raids, with six, including **Mazahir, Akif, Ayaz, and Bakir Safarov, Ahliman Ganjayev, and Shahin Lalayev**, facing charges related to murder, attempted murder, and contract killings dating back to 2001, 2010, and 2011. Russian authorities claimed these individuals were members of an organized criminal group involved in business-related disputes and personal revenge.

### Azerbaijan’s Swift Response: Raids and Arrests in Baku

In a clear retaliatory move, Azerbaijani authorities launched their own operations in Baku from June 30 to July 1. The Ministry of Internal Affairs conducted a raid on the office of “Sputnik Azerbaijan,” the Baku branch of the Russian state-owned “Rossiya Segodnya” agency, whose accreditation had been revoked in February.

Initially, seven Russian citizens were detained, though Russian media outlet “Meduza” later reported the number to be ten, including businessmen, IT specialists, and tourists. Among those arrested were **Igor Kartavykh**, executive director of “Sputnik Azerbaijan,” and its chief editor, **Evgeny Belousov**, both of whom were placed in pre-trial detention for four months. The charges against the detainees are extensive, ranging from fraud and illegal entrepreneurship to money laundering, illegal drug trafficking, and cybercrime.

Disturbing reports emerged, corroborated by the Russian Embassy in Baku and human rights project “Kovcheg,” alleging that “physical violence was used against them and their family members.” Photos from Azerbaijani courtrooms reportedly showed signs of torture and bloodstains on the clothes of some Russian detainees.

While five Azerbaijani employees of “Sputnik Azerbaijan” were later released after signing pledges not to leave the country, the Russian staff remain in custody, leading to **Dmitry Kiselyov**, Director General of “Rossiya Segodnya,” to declare that “there are no conditions for ‘Sputnik-Azerbaijan’ to continue its activities in this country.”

### Diplomatic Fallout and Mutual Accusations

The escalating events quickly triggered a full-blown diplomatic crisis. Both countries summoned each other’s ambassadors. On July 2, Russia’s Ambassador to Azerbaijan, **Mikhail Evdokimov**, was summoned to the Azerbaijani Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), where Deputy Minister **Araz Azimov** conveyed a “protest regarding the unfriendly actions and steps of the Russian side that undermine relations between the two countries.” Azerbaijan also dismissed Russian objections to the “Sputnik Azerbaijan” operation as “unfounded,” stating that the measures were in line with Azerbaijani law.

The Azerbaijani MFA further criticized Russia for failing to conduct a “full and transparent investigation” into the AZAL passenger plane incident over Grozny in late 2024, which Azerbaijan attributes to Russia. It also condemned the “disinformation campaign” and “ethnic intolerance” observed in Russian media against Azerbaijanis.

In Moscow, Russian MFA spokesperson **Maria Zakharova** urged Russian citizens to “carefully consider the current situation” before traveling to Azerbaijan and called on Baku to return to the “strategic alliance” level of relations. Kremlin spokesperson **Dmitry Peskov** acknowledged images showing signs of violence on Russian detainees in Baku, vowing to defend their interests through all available means. He also noted ongoing contact between **Alexander Bastrykin**, Chairman of the Russian Investigative Committee, and Azerbaijani Prosecutor General **Kamran Aliyev** to address the incidents.

### Broader Context and Underlying Tensions

This latest flare-up is not an isolated incident but rather the culmination of simmering tensions. Relations have been “chilly” since the AZAL plane incident in late 2024, for which Russia has not taken responsibility. Local Azerbaijani media recently published a claim by Russian captain **Dmitry Paladichuk** that he received an order to shoot down the “Embraer 190.”

Azerbaijan had previously taken steps seen as distancing itself from Moscow, including closing the “Russian House” (accusing its employees of espionage), limiting the stay of Russians in the country to 90 days per year, and drastically reducing “Sputnik Azerbaijan” staff.

Analysts offer various interpretations for Russia’s actions. Some, like political analyst **Nasimi Mammadli**, suggest Russia is unhappy with Azerbaijan’s independent foreign policy and its growing influence in the region, especially as Armenia also seeks to move away from Moscow’s orbit. Others, like political commentator **Shahim Jafarli**, argue that Russia views its alliances with former colonies as suzerain-vassal relationships rather than equal partnerships, a stance that displeases Baku. The potential realization of the Zangezur Corridor, connecting Azerbaijan’s mainland to its Nakhchivan exclave through Armenian territory, possibly with Turkish mediation, is also seen as a point of contention, with Russia potentially trying to prevent it.

### Human Rights Concerns and International Reaction

The human rights implications of the reciprocal arrests have drawn international attention. **Marie Struthers**, Amnesty International’s Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, strongly condemned the alleged human rights violations in both countries. She stated that “torture and other ill-treatment are absolutely prohibited under international law and can never be justified,” and called for “immediate, thorough, independent, and impartial” investigations into all allegations of unlawful killings, torture, and ill-treatment.

The UN, through spokesperson **Stephane Dujarric**, expressed hope that the tensions would be resolved through diplomatic channels, within the framework of the rule of law, and emphasized the importance of ensuring journalists’ freedom to operate. The European Union’s spokesperson, **Anitta Hipper**, also condemned the “intolerable” and “brutal actions” by Russian security forces against ethnic Azerbaijanis.

### Economic Impact and Vulnerabilities

Beyond the diplomatic and human rights concerns, the escalating tensions carry significant economic risks. Azerbaijan’s economy is heavily reliant on trade with Russia. In the first five months of 2025, Azerbaijan’s imports from Russia ($1.715 billion) were nearly four times its exports to Russia ($445 million). Russia is Azerbaijan’s third-largest trade partner overall and its largest market for non-oil exports, accounting for 31.5% of these exports.

Agricultural products, particularly tomatoes, are a critical component of Azerbaijan’s exports to Russia, with some economists estimating up to 90% dependence for certain agricultural goods. **Rashad Hasanov**, an economist, warned that any economic pressure, such as a “tomato embargo” (a threat already voiced by Kremlin-affiliated media), would create “serious difficulties for Azerbaijani exporters” and could lead to significant losses for local farmers.

Furthermore, a substantial portion of Azerbaijan’s population relies on remittances from migrants working in Russia. While official figures cite 657,000 migrants, unofficial estimates suggest at least 2 million, sending home an estimated $1.5-2 billion annually. A reduction in these remittances could severely impact social welfare in regions like southern and Gazakh-Shamkir, potentially leading to increased unemployment and social tension if migrants return home.

Despite these vulnerabilities, both countries have expressed interest in expanding economic ties, particularly through joint projects like the “North-South” international transport corridor. However, economists like **Natig Jafarli** highlight that Azerbaijan’s 80% dependence on Russia for agricultural exports is unsustainable, urging the country to seek “new, more premium markets.”

### An Uncertain Path Forward

The current crisis underscores the complex and often volatile nature of Azerbaijan-Russia relations. Both are, as economist Rashad Hasanov notes, “economies managed by the will of one person,” making rapid shifts in policy and economic measures a constant risk.

While some analysts suggest that Russia and Azerbaijan have historically “played into each other’s hands,” the severity of the current events, involving deaths and allegations of torture, marks a significant departure. The future trajectory remains uncertain. Some believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin will ultimately seek common ground to avoid rupturing relations with Turkey, a key player in the region and a potential mediator. Others, however, warn that if Azerbaijan does not take more decisive steps, such as democratic reforms, the Kremlin’s influence on Azerbaijan’s internal affairs could persist.

The international community’s calls for adherence to the rule of law and human rights, coupled with the domestic economic pressures, will undoubtedly shape how this escalating crisis unfolds.
