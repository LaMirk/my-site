**Baku, Azerbaijan** – In a move that has drawn sharp criticism from international human rights and media organizations, an Azerbaijani court on June 20 handed down severe prison sentences to journalists from “Abzas Media” and Radio Azadliq’s Farid Mehralizade. The verdicts, which the journalists vehemently deny, are widely seen as politically motivated reprisals for their investigations into high-level corruption.

### A Crackdown on Independent Reporting

The arrests in the “Abzas Media case” began on November 20, 2023, primarily targeting the investigative outlet known for its corruption exposés in Azerbaijan. The crackdown intensified with the subsequent arrest of Farid Mehralizade in May 2024. While officially charged with offenses such as smuggling, illegal entrepreneurship, legalization of criminally obtained property, and tax evasion, the journalists and their supporters maintain that these accusations are fabricated and designed to silence independent voices.

### The Verdicts: Years Behind Bars

On June 20, at the Baku Court of Grave Crimes, Judge Rasim Sadikhov presided over the sentencing. The court delivered the following harsh judgments:

**Ulvi Hasanli**, director of “Abzas Media,” **Sevinj Vagifgizi**, editor-in-chief, **Hafiz Babali**, investigative journalist, and **Farid Mehralizade**, a journalist and economist for Radio Azadliq, were each sentenced to **9 years** in prison.

Reporters **Nargiz Absalamova** and **Elnara Gasimova** received **8-year** sentences.

**Mahammad Kekalov**, coordinator for “Abzas Media,” was sentenced to **7 years and 6 months** of imprisonment.

During the reading of the verdict, the accused journalists notably turned their backs to the judges in a powerful act of defiance. They held up posters referencing corruption investigations involving President Ilham Aliyev’s family members, Beyler Eyyubov, and Ali Naghiyev. Some even recited a poem by Ali Bey Huseynzade, underscoring their commitment to truth despite their predicament.

### Journalists Speak Out: “The Verdict is Not the Judges'”

In their final statements before the verdict, the journalists unequivocally rejected the charges and asserted their arrests were a direct consequence of their professional work.

**Ulvi Hasanli** emphasized that they were being punished “solely for conducting corruption investigations related to President Ilham Aliyev and his inner circle.” He expressed no regret over his arrest, viewing it as an “experience” and stating that while their physical freedom could be taken, their “freedom of thought, expression, and speech” could not.

**Sevinj Vagifgizi** echoed Hasanli’s sentiments, highlighting that their arrests stemmed from investigations into President Aliyev and his close associates. She suggested that the “reliable source” mentioned in the investigation materials was, in fact, Ilham Aliyev himself. Vagifgizi also drew parallels to historical Azerbaijani journalists, forced to work in secret, implying that figures like Uzeyir Hajibeyli would also face repression under the current regime.

**Mahammad Kekalov** denounced the accusations as “fabricated and false.” In a symbolic gesture, he presented copies of George Orwell’s “1984” to the prosecutor and judges, stating, “You need to read these books, because you are among those who brought this country to this state.”

**Nargiz Absalamova**, who chose journalism despite family opposition, recounted facing police brutality and even a broken bone during her career. She warned that “if there is injustice in a country, one day it will find you too.” In a striking moment, she offered heart medication to the judges, sarcastically noting that they “turn pale and flush” whenever Ilham Aliyev’s name is mentioned.

**Elnara Gasimova** pointed to a “total crackdown on independent media” since November 2023. She lamented Azerbaijan’s low ranking (167th out of 180 countries) in press freedom, asserting that independent journalists have no obligation to appease the president and would not surrender.

**Farid Mehralizade**, reflecting on his detention, shared that the most common question he faced was, “Did you need this?” He firmly stated that the accusations against him were unsubstantiated, arguing, “The verdict you will read will not be the judges’ verdict, but the verdict of those who ordered our arrest.” He challenged the prosecution’s reliance on a retracted statement and the lack of concrete evidence, highlighting that simply traveling abroad was presented as “proof” of smuggling.

### International Condemnation and Calls for Release

The harsh sentences have triggered a wave of condemnation from international human rights and media organizations, who view the trial as a mockery of justice:

**Amnesty International** called for the immediate release of the journalists, stating their “only ‘crime’ was to convey the truth to the public.”

**Gulnoza Said**, Coordinator of the Europe and Central Asia Program at the **Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ)**, emphasized that the 80-year total sentence demanded by the prosecution signifies a crushing of independent media in Azerbaijan. She warned that the verdict would determine whether Azerbaijan “completely destroy[s] independent journalism” and urged the international community to act if mass arrests continue.

**Reporters Without Borders (RSF)** labeled the verdict a “parody of justice” and asserted that the charges were “clearly fabricated and politically motivated.” Ann Bokande, RSF’s Director of Editorial Operations, declared the verdict to have “no legitimacy whatsoever” and demanded the journalists’ immediate and unconditional release.

**Stephen Capus**, President of **Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty**, decried Mehralizade’s sentence as “unnecessary cruelty,” especially given that he has been unjustly detained for over a year and has not seen the birth of his child.

Locally, **Rashad Majid**, Chairman of the Press Council, acknowledged the differing opinions but maintained that the Council “does not positively view the arrest of such individuals.” While admitting that a “political essence” might be highlighted, he reiterated that official narratives claim arrests are not solely due to journalistic activities. However, he stated the Council is “far from disputing the court’s verdict.”

### Ongoing Repression and a Plea for Justice

The “Abzas Media case” is part of a broader pattern of repression in Azerbaijan. Currently, over 30 journalists and public activists are imprisoned on similar charges, all denying the accusations and claiming political persecution. Local human rights organizations estimate there are 375 political prisoners in Azerbaijani prisons.

Despite official denials of politically motivated arrests, international human rights bodies continue to urge the Azerbaijani government to release those unjustly detained and to cease crackdowns on independent media and civil society. The future of media freedom in Azerbaijan remains a significant concern for the global community.
