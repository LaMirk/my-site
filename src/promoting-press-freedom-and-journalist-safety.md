The organization’s reporting has been instrumental in bringing the issues of press freedom in Azerbaijan to the attention of relevant organizations and officials in the US and Europe. IRFS has been a member of the International Freedom of Expression Exchange (IFEX) since October 2007 and Global Network Initiative (GNI) since November 2012.

IRFS plays a key role in monitoring the safety of journalists and in working to combat the prevailing culture of impunity among the perpetrators of crimes against them. Since its establishment in 2006, IRFS has been doing pioneering work in guaranteeing Azerbaijani media professionals the right to work free from the threat of violence, fighting for the full implementation of the right to freedom of expression. In July 2011, with funds provided by the Copenhagen-based International Media Support (IMS), IRFS launched a targeted safety strategy to introduce a safety mechanism that includes fast-track responses to journalists under threat, a hotline, safety and secure communications training for journalists.

In order to create further synergies vis-à-vis promotion of journalist safety, IRFS now works to achieve two specific objectives:

• Encourage a culture in which journalists and media workers are able to take responsibility for their personal safety.
• Reduce external risks to journalist safety via deployment of pioneering tools/activities.
